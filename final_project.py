"""
Notes about the salt, salt length can be brute forced because 
common hashing algorithms digest sizes are known, and assuming that 
the user is using a common digest algorithm, the salt = (password - digestLength), 
and it is almost always at the beginning or end of the password, though security could
potentially perform a known permutation function on your salt + password, which could 
really slow down a hackers attempt to decrypt the password 
"""

"""
Notes about rounds, when decrypting here, we make an assumption that the password goes
through 100,000 rounds. This is not something that an attacker would know, they would
need to likely test all rounds between, though they could cheat and test regularly occuring
rounds, like 100,000 += some easy number, as that is what is found in most password documentation
"""

"""
Notes on password security, here we've shown that it is not that difficult to determine known 
passwords, which as we've seen can be millions of passwords. These passwords can be reasonably cracked
with moderate computer power and not too much cryptography knowledge nor coding experience. However,
if your password is simply a set of random characters the time it would take to crack your password would increase
exponentially. Rather than a simple brute force attack, an attacker would have to try every combination of strings,
which could be somewhere near 32^(56) combinations which is the below number of combinations, for passwords up to 32 
characters long, with 56 different characters to choose from, an unrealistic number of combinations for a current 
computer to process

Will probably only use something like 5000 rounds so it will be less computationally expensive, and then extrapolate how 
long it would take for 100000 to process
